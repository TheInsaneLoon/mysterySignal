# 🛸 The Myth of the Black Knight Satellite

## 🕵️‍♂️ What Is the Black Knight Satellite?

The theory claims there's a mysterious, possibly extraterrestrial satellite orbiting Earth in a near-polar orbit, allegedly watching us for 13,000 years. It’s said to transmit strange signals and defy explanation by space agencies.

## 🧩 Origins of the Myth

The legend is a mashup of several unrelated events:

- 1899: Nikola Tesla reportedly received unusual radio signals, which some later speculated came from space.
- 1928: Norwegian engineer Jørgen Hals detected long-delayed radio echoes (LDEs), which added fuel to the mystery.
- 1954: UFO researcher Donald Keyhoe claimed the U.S. Air Force had detected two satellites—before any nation had launched one.
- 1960: The U.S. Navy spotted a dark object in orbit, later identified as a piece of a failed satellite.

## 📸 The 1998 STS-88 Photos

NASA astronauts aboard the STS-88 mission photographed a strange, black object floating in space. Conspiracy theorists latched onto it as “proof” of the Black Knight. NASA, however, identified it as a lost thermal blanket from the shuttle.

## 🧠 Why It Persists

Despite being debunked, the myth endures because:

- It’s a perfect storm of mystery, science fiction, and misinterpreted data.
- The photos look eerie and alien-like.
- People love the idea of a watchful alien probe silently orbiting Earth.

## 🧪 Scientific Consensus

Experts like NASA engineer James Oberg and astronomers have repeatedly stated that the object is space debris, not an alien satellite. Tesla’s signals were likely from natural sources like pulsars, which weren’t discovered until decades later.
