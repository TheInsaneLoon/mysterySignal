# 📡 Mystery Signal

*A text-based Python adventure game set against the backdrop of conspiracy, cosmic uncertainty, and cold logic.*

## 🛰️ Concept

You're an amateur radio astronomer who intercepts a mysterious binary signal. It's erratic. Faint. Familiar. Suspected to originate from the legendary **Black Knight Satellite**, the transmission resurfaces after decades of silence. As you trace the source, you'll face real-world obstacles, cryptic anomalies, and choices that ripple through multiple narrative paths.

## 🎮 Gameplay Highlights

- **Terminal-based exploration:** Choose your starting location — Observatory, Field Station, or Mountain Relay — each with unique signal behaviors and outcomes.
- **Decision-driven progression:** Every scan, decode, and movement influences signal quality, battery drain, and risk exposure.
- **Signal decay mechanics:** Fail to stabilize transmissions and the signal disappears forever.
- **Multiple endings:** Outcomes range from alien contact to government interference, false leads, and scientific breakthroughs.
- **Replayable paths:** With randomized events and branching logic, each run tells a different story.

## 🧪 Technology + Structure

- Built using Python 3 with a focus on:
  - Functions, lists, dictionaries
  - Simple class integration (SignalScanner)
  - ASCII UI elements for immersion
  - Optional color via `colorama`
- Clean, modular code base ready for extension or GUI wrapping post-project
- Planned for executable packaging via `pyinstaller` for Windows demo distribution

## 🗃️ Future Enhancements

- Adaptive splash screens based on location choice
- Weighted win/lose outcomes influenced by player behavior
- Terminal resizing hints for best visual experience
- Embedded lore files or signal logs for deeper immersion

## 🕶️ Tone + Inspirations

Combines the conspiracy intrigue of the **Black Knight Satellite** legend with the eerie realism of SETI-style signal tracking. Inspired by games like **Signal Simulator**, **Lifeline**, and vintage BBS adventure prompts — but shaped by a modern scripting mindset.
